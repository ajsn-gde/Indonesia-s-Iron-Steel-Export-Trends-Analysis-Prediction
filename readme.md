# Key Indicator 

- **Export Revenue**: Total export revenue
- **Import Revenue**: Total import revenue
- **Trade Balance**: Export revenue minus import revenue

# Summary of Insights

- China dominates both as the largest export destination and the largest importer to Indonesia, with export revenue from China amounting to 24,428,805,843.99 USD and imports from China totaling 8,235,481,424 USD.
- However, there is still a surplus in export-import activities with China, indicating potential for expanding export efforts to China.
- The most dominant mineral exports to China are iron and steel, far outpacing other minerals.

# Next Steps

- Conduct a forecast for iron and steel export revenue to China over the next year to ensure the potential for expanding the iron and steel export business to China.

# Forecasting Result
![Forecasting](https://github.com/ajsn-gde/Indonesia-s-Iron-Steel-Export-Trends-Analysis-Prediction/raw/main/historicaltrend.png)
-Based on the export revenue forecast for the next 12 months, the trend tends to decline and only started to surge again since August. Therefore, it can be said that February 2025 is not the right time to venture into the iron and steel export business. However, it is worth trying from August 2025 to December 2025.
