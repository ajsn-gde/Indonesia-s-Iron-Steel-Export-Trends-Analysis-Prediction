# Summary of Insights

- China dominates both as the largest export destination and the largest importer to Indonesia, with export revenue from China amounting to 24,428,805,843.99 USD and imports from China totaling 8,235,481,424 USD.
- However, there is still a surplus in export-import activities with China, indicating potential for expanding export efforts to China.
- The most dominant mineral exports to China are iron and steel, far outpacing other minerals.

# Next Steps

- Conduct a forecast for iron and steel export revenue to China over the next year to ensure the potential for expanding the iron and steel export business to China.
